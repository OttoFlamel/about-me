# about-me
I want to introduce myself and I've just read that I should create a repository with "README" file, that's why you can see it now=) 

So I'm a beginner, at first I'd like to learn how to make bots for DISCORD whis python (it's the only one language that I know at the moment, but I'm going to learn more. Don't shame me, please) 

I'm trying to make an archivist bot while my friends are trying to find the way to save information for our own projects. As you can see I chose perhaps not the easiest option, but it sounds interesting.
